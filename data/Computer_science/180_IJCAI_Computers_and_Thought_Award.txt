The IJCAI Computers and Thought Award is presented every two years by the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), recognizing outstanding young scientists in artificial intelligence. It was originally funded with royalties received from the book Computers and Thought (edited by Edward Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman), and is currently funded by IJCAI.
It is considered to be "the premier award for artificial intelligence researchers under the age of 35".
