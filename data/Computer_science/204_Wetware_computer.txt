A wetware computer is an organic computer (also known as an artificial organic brain or a neurocomputer) built from living neurons. Professor Bill Ditto, at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is the primary researcher driving the creation of these artificially constructed, but still organic brains. One prototype is constructed from leech neurons, and is capable of performing simple arithmetic operations. The concepts are still being researched and prototyped, but in the near future, it is expected that artificially constructed organic brains, even though they are still considerably simpler in design than animal brains, should be capable of simple pattern recognition tasks such as handwriting recognition.
