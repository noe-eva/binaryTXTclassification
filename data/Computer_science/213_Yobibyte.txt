The yobibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. It is a member of the set of units with binary prefixes defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Its unit symbol is YiB
The prefix yobi (symbol Yi) represents multiplication by 10248, therefore:
1 yobibyte = 280 bytes = 1208925819614629174706176bytes = 1024 zebibytes
The prefixes zebi and yobi were originally not part of the system of binary prefixes, but were added by the IEC in August 2005.
