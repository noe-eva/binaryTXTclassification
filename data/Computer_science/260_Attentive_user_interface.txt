Attentive user interfaces (AUI) are user interfaces that manage the user's attention. For instance, an AUI can manage notifications (Horvitz et al. 2003), deciding when to interrupt the user, the kind of warnings, and the level of detail of the messages presented to the user. Attentive user interfaces, by generating only the relevant information, can in particular be used to display information in a way that increase the effectiveness of the interaction (Huberman & Wu 2008).
According to Vertegaal, there are four main types of attentive user interfaces (Vertegaal 2003) (Vertegaal et al. 2006):
Visual attention
Turn management
Interruption decision interfaces
Visual detail management interfaces
