In metadata, an identification scheme is used to identify unique records in a set.
If a data element is used to identify a record within a data set, the data element uses the Identifier representation term.
An identification scheme should be contrasted with a classification scheme. Classification schemes are used to classify individual records into categories. Many records in a data set may be in a single category.
