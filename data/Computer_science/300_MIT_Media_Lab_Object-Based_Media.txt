The Object-Based Media Group at the MIT Media Lab, led by V. Michael Bove, Jr., explores the creative and technological applications and implications of the intersection of context-aware consumer electronics and self-aware digital content. Projects include immersive, interactive, and personalized television, 3-D display technologies (in particular computer generated holography), novel user interfaces, and applications that run on ecosystems of consumer electronics devices. Graduate students in the group typically have backgrounds in signal processing and understanding, image capture and display (especially in 3-D), user interfaces, technical and creative aspects of new media forms, and/or consumer electronics product design.
