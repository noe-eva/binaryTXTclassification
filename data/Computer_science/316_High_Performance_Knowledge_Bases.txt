The High Performance Knowledge Bases (HPKB) was a DARPA research program to advance the technology of how computers acquire, represent and manipulate knowledge. The successor of the HPKB project was the Rapid Knowledge Formation (RKF) project.
The primary results of the HPKB project was to focus further research on the Knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem.

Technology developers
Challenge problem developers
