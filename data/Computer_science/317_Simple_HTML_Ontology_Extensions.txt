In the semantic web, Simple HTML Ontology Extensions are a small set of HTML extensions designed to give web pages semantic meaning by allowing information such as class, subclass and property relationships.â‰¤
SHOE was developed around 1996 by Sean Luke, Lee Spector, James Hendler, Jeff Heflin, and David Rager at the University of Maryland, College Park.
