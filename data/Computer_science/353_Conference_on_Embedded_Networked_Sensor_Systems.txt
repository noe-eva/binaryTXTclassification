SenSys, the ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, is an annual academic conference in the area of embedded networked sensors.


== About SenSys ==
ACM SenSys is a selective, single-track forum for the presentation of research results on systems issues in the area of embedded networked sensors. The conference provides a venue to address the research challenges facing the design, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Sensor networks require contributions from many fields, from wireless communication and networking, embedded systems and hardware, distributed systems, data management, and applications. SenSys welcomes cross-disciplinary work.


== Ranking ==
Although there is no official ranking of academic conferences on wireless sensor networks, SenSys is widely regarded by researchers as one of the two (along with IPSN) most prestigious conferences focusing on sensor network research. SenSys focuses more on system issues while IPSN on algorithmic and theoretical considerations. The acceptance rate for 2017 was 17.2% (26 out of 151 papers accepted for publication).
