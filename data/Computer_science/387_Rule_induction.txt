Rule induction is an area of machine learning in which formal rules are extracted from a set of observations. The rules extracted may represent a full scientific model of the data, or merely represent local patterns in the data.


== Paradigms ==
Some major rule induction paradigms are:
Association rule learning algorithms (e.g., Aggrawal)
Decision rule algorithms (e.g., Quinlan 1987)
Hypothesis testing algorithms (e.g., RULEX)
Horn clause induction
Version spaces
Rough set rules
Inductive Logic Programming
Boolean decomposition (Feldman)


== Algorithms ==
Some rule induction algorithms are:
Charade
Rulex
Progol
CN2
