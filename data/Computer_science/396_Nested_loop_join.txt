A nested loop join is a naive algorithm that joins two sets by using two nested loops. Join operations are important to database management.


== Algorithm ==
Two relations 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   and 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   are joined as follows:

  For each tuple r in R do
     For each tuple s in S do
        If r and s satisfy the join condition
           Then output the tuple <r,s>

This algorithm will involve nr*bs+ br block transfers and nr+br seeks, where br and bs are number of blocks in relations R and S respectively, and nr is the number of tuples in relation R.
The algorithm runs in 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          |
        
        R
        
          |
        
        
          |
        
        S
        
          |
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(|R||S|)}
   I/Os, where 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        R
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |R|}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        S
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |S|}
   is the number of tuples contained in 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   and 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   respectively and can easily be generalized to join any number of relations.
The block nested loop join algorithm is a generalization of the simple nested loops algorithm that takes advantage of additional memory to reduce the number of times that the 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   relation is scanned.
