In computer science, a maximal pair is a tuple 
  
    
      
        (
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        l
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (p_{1},p_{2},l)}
  , such that, given a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   of length 
  
    
      
        n

        =
        S
        [
        
          p

        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle S[p_{1}..p_{1}+l-1]=S[p_{2}..p_{2}+l-1]}
  , but 
  
    
      
        S
        [
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        −
        1
        ]
        ≠
        S
        [

            2
          
        
        −

        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle S[p_{1}-1]\neq S[p_{2}-1]}
   and 
  
    
      
        S
        [
        
          p
          
            1

        ≠

          p
          
            2

        l
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle S[p_{1}+l]\neq S[p_{2}+l]}
  . A maximal repeat is a string represented by such tuple. A supermaximal repeat is a maximal repeat never occurring as a proper substring of another maximal repeat. Both maximal pairs, maximal repeats and supermaximal repeats can be found in 
  
    
      
        Θ
        (
        n
        +
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta (n+z)}
   time using a suffix tree, if there are 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   such structures.


== Example ==

  
    
      
        (
        2
        ,
        6
        ,
        3
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (2,6,3)}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        6
        ,
        10
        ,
        3
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (6,10,3)}
   are maximal pairs as the referenced substrings do not share identical characters to the left or the right.

  
    
      
        (
        2
        ,
        10
        ,
        3
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (2,10,3)}
   is not, as the character y follows both substrings.
abc and abcy are maximal repeats, but only abcy is a supermaximal repeat.
