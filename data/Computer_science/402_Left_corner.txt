The left corner of a production rule in a context-free grammar is the left-most symbol on the right side of the rule.
For example, in the rule A→Xα, X is the left corner.
The left corner table associates a symbol with all possible left corners for that symbol, and the left corners of those symbols, etc.
Given the grammar
S→VP
S→NP VP
VP→V NP
NP→DET N
Left corners are used to add bottom-up filtering of a top-down parser.
You can use the left corners to do top-down filtering of a bottom-up parser.
