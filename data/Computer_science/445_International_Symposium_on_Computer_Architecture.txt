The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is an annual academic conference on computer architecture, generally viewed as the top-tier in the field. Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture (ACM SIGARCH) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society are technical sponsors.
ISCA has participated in the Federated Computing Research Conference in 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015, every year that the conference has been organized.
