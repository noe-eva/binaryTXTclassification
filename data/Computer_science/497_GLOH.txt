GLOH (Gradient Location and Orientation Histogram) is a robust image descriptor that can be used in computer vision tasks. It is a SIFT-like descriptor that considers more spatial regions for the histograms. The higher dimensionality of the descriptor is reduced to 64 through principal components analysis (PCA).
