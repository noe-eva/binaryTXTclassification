Zero address arithmetic is a feature of a few innovative computer architectures, whereby the assignment to a physical address space is deferred until programming statement execution time. It eliminates the link step of conventional compile and link architectures, and more generally relocation.
All Burroughs large systems and medium systems had this property, as do their modern day successors that preserve the original physical architecture.
The 1960 announcement of the English Electric KDF9 is the first announcement of a zero-address instruction format computer, rapidly followed by the Burroughs B5000.
