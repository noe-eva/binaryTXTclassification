The Computer Science Tripos is the undergraduate course in computer science offered by the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. It evolved out of the Diploma in Computer Science, the worldâ€™s first taught course in computer science, which started in 1953. Successful candidates are awarded a BA (Bachelor of Arts) honours degree after three years or, optionally, a combined BA + MEng (Master of Engineering) honours degree after four years of study.
