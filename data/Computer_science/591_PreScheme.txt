PreScheme or Pre-Scheme is a statically-typed dialect of Scheme with the efficiency and low-level machine access of C while retaining many of the desirable features of Scheme.
The PreScheme compiler is a part of Scheme48.


== Variants ==
Macro-Free PreScheme
Obtained from Full PreScheme by expanding all macros.
Pure PreScheme
A tail-recursive, closure-free dialect of PreScheme, obtained from Macro-Free PreScheme by hoisting lambda expressions and beta expansion.
VLISP PreScheme
Simple PreScheme
