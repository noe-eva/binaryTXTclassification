== Structure ==
The Institute of IT Professionals is a single nationwide non-profit incorporated society.
Within the Institute are five branches based on geographic location, being Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, Waikato/Bay of Plenty, and Otago/Southland. The IITP also encompasses a number of Specialist Groups in topics such as Software Testing and Computer Security. IITP branches and specialist groups are staffed by volunteers.
The Institute is governed by a National Council made up of the IITP President, Deputy President, and five Councillors, with each councillor being appointed by one of the branches of the Institute.
The Institute maintains a fully staffed operational head office in Wellington and is managed by a Chief Executive who also sits on Council in a non-voting capacity.


== Advocacy ==
IITP is regarded as the voice of the ICT profession in New Zealand and undertakes significant advocacy on behalf of the profession and wider sector.
IITP is represented on most ICT-related advisory groups, panels and public ICT-related boards in New Zealand, and was a founding member of the Digital Development Council, a body set up by the New Zealand Government to help achieve New Zealand's digital potential.
The Institute is engaged with government (both ministerial and official level), industry and academia and works as a catalyst and conduit for these three important sub-sectors to work together in the interests of the overall ICT Sector, both in the area of ethics and professional practice as well as to solve issues such as the current ICT skills shortage and drop in tertiary ICT enrolments.
IITP also takes an active interest in educational issues and in 2008 completed a detailed analysis of ICT-related NCEA Achievement Standards in secondary schools and outlined a number of significant and serious problems with these standards.
The Institute also promotes digital literacy.


== Certification ==
In 2009 the Institute released an internationally aligned ICT professional certification in New Zealand, the Information Technology Certified Professional (ITCP) qualification.


== Events ==
The IITP runs numerous events throughout New Zealand, but predominantly in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Dunedin.
As well as around 20 local events a month, the Institute began a monthly nationwide Innovators of ICT event series in August 2008, taking notable and successful entrepreneurs such as Rod Drury and Don Christie on a speaking trip to the five cities above to promote innovation and "thinking outside the square" to New Zealand's development and ICT community.


== History ==
The Institute was founded as the New Zealand Data Processing and Computer Society Inc in October 1960 in Wellington, New Zealand and changed its name to New Zealand Computer Society Inc in 1967.


== Honorary Fellowships ==
The IITP occasionally confers the title of Honorary Fellow of the IITP (HFIITP) on an individual who has made a significant contribution to the ICT sector in New Zealand over a period of time, or the Institute itself over many years.
HFIITP recipients include former Minister of ICT Hon David Cunliffe and ICT entrepreneur Rod Drury. There are currently 25 Honorary Fellows.


== International Relationships ==
The IITP is a full member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), an international umbrella organisation originally set up by UNESCO, and South East Asia Regional Computer Confederation (SEARCC).
The Institute also works with other professional bodies around the world, such as the Australian Computer Society and the British Computer Society.
