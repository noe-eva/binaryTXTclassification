Jürgen Schmidhuber (born 17 January 1963) is a computer scientist who works in the field of artificial intelligence. He is a co-director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research in Manno, in the district of Lugano, in Ticino in southern Switzerland.
Schmidhuber did his undergraduate studies at the Technische Universität München in Munich, Germany. He taught there from 2004 until 2009 when he became a professor of artificial intelligence at the Università della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland.


== Work ==
In 1997, Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiter published a paper on a type of recurrent neural network which they called Long short-term memory. In 2015, this was used in a new implementation of speech recognition in Google's software for smartphones.
In 2014, Schmidhuber formed a company, Nnaisense, to work on commercial applications of artificial intelligence in fields such as finance, heavy industry and self-driving cars. Sepp Hochreiter, Jaan Tallinn, and Marcus Hutter are advisers to the company.


== Recognition ==
Schmidhuber received the Helmholtz Award of the International Neural Network Society in 2013, and the Neural Networks Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society in 2016. He is a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.
