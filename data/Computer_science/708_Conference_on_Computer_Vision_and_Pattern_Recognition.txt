The Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition is an annual conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, by several measures regarded as the top conference in computer vision. 


== Official Affiliations ==
CVPR was first held in Washington DC in 1983 by Takeo Kanade and Dana Ballard (previously the conference was named Pattern Recognition and Image Processing). From 1985-2010 it was sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. In 2011 it was co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and by University of Colorado Colorado Springs. Since 2012 it has been co-sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and the Computer Vision Foundation(CVF). CVF now provides open access to the conference papers.


== Scope ==
CVPR considers a wide range of topics related to computer vision and pattern recognition—basically any topic that is extracting structures or answers from images or video or applying mathematical methods to data to extract or recognize patterns. Each year the conference has an explicit list of topics for that year. The conference event also includes a wide range of workshops and tutorials. Each year multiple company also donate funds to support the conference and many of those also exhibit at the conference.
The conference is highly selective with generally < 30% acceptance rates for all papers and < 5% for oral presentations. The conference is managed by a rotating group of volunteers who are chosen in a public election at the PAMI-TC meeting four years before the meeting. CVPR uses a multi-tier double-blind review process. The Program Chairs (who cannot submit papers), select 50-60 Area Chairs who manage the reviewers for their subset of reviewers. There are generally three or more reviewers per paper. The Area Chairs discuss the paper with the reviewers then among the ACs and finally produce a meta-review and make a recommendation the Program Chairs, who make the final decisions.


== Location ==
The conference is usually held in June and rotates around the U.S. generally West, Central and East. In 2013 the conference was in Portland, OR. In 2014 the conference was held in Columbus, OH with over 1900 attendees. In 2015 it was in Boston, MA. In 2016 it was in Las Vegas, NV. In 2017 it was held in Honolulu, HI.
Future meetings are planned as follows:
2018 in Salt Lake City, UT
2019 in Long Beach, CA
2020 in Seattle, WA
