The Tsutomu Kanai Award was established in 1997 by a generous endowment from Hitachi Ltd., and named in honor of Dr. Tsutomu Kanai who serves as Hitachiâ€™s president for 30 years. The Kanai Award may be presented annually upon the recommendation of the Kanai Award subcommittee, endorsement of the Awards Committee and approval of the Board of Governors.

The Kanai Award recognizes major contributions to the state-of-the-art distributed computing systems and their applications.
In the evaluation process, the following criteria are considered: seminal nature of the achievements, practical impact, breadth and depth of contributions, and quality of the nomination. The IEEE Computer Society was honored to present Ken Thompson with the very first Tsutomu Award, 10 June 1999.
The award consists of a crystal model, certificate, and $10,000 honorarium. Deadline: 15 October of each year
The award is open to all, and anyone may nominate. The award requires three endorsements.
