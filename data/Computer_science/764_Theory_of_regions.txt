The Theory of regions is an approach for synthesizing a Petri net from a transition system. As such, it aims at recovering concurrent, independent behaviour from transitions between global states. Theory of regions handles elementary net systems as well as P/T nets and other kinds of nets. An important point is that the approach is aimed at the synthesis of unlabeled Petri nets only.


== Definition ==
A region of a transition system 
  
    
      
        (
        S
        ,
        Λ
        ,
        →
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (S,\Lambda ,\rightarrow )}
   is a mapping assigning to each state 
  
    
      
        s
        ∈
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\in S}
   a number 
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (s)}
   (natural number for P/T nets, binary for ENS) and to each transition label a number 
  
    
      
        τ
        (
        ℓ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau (\ell )}
   such that consistency conditions 
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        
          s
          ′
        
        )
        =
        σ
        (
        s
        )
        +
        τ
        (
        ℓ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (s')=\sigma (s)+\tau (\ell )}
   holds whenever 
  
    
      
        (
        s
        ,
        ℓ
        ,
        
          s
          ′
        
        )
        ∈→
      
    
    {\displaystyle (s,\ell ,s')\in \rightarrow }
  .


=== Intuitive explanation ===
Each region represents a potential place of a Petri net.
Mukund: event/state separation property, state separation property.
