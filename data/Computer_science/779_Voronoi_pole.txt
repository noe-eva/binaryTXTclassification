In geometry, the positive and negative Voronoi poles of a cell in a Voronoi diagram are certain vertices of the diagram.


== Definition ==
Let 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{p}}
   be the Voronoi cell of the site 
  
    
      
        p
        ∈
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\in P}
  . If 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{p}}
   is bounded then its positive pole is the Voronoi vertex in 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{p}}
   with maximal distance to the sample point 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  . Furthermore, let 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}}
   be the vector from 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   to the positive pole. If the cell is unbounded, then a positive pole is not defined, and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}}
   is defined to be a vector in the average direction of all unbounded Voronoi edges of the cell.
The negative pole is the Voronoi vertex 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   in 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{p}}
   with the largest distance to 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   such that the vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}}
   and the vector from 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   to 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   make an angle larger than 
  
    
      
        
          
            π
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}}
  .


== Example ==

Here 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the positive pole of 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{p}}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   its negative. As the cell corresponding to 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
   is unbounded only the negative pole 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   exists.
