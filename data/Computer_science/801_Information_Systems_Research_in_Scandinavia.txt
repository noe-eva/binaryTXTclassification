The IRIS (Information Systems Research in Scandinavia) Association is a non-profit organization aiming to promote research and research education in the use, development and management of information systems in Scandinavia, and making that research known in the international research community and among practitioners. The IRIS association publishes the Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems (SJIS) and holds the IRIS Conference as well as the Scandinavian Conference on Information Systems Conference (SCIS). Its current president is Judith Molka-Danielsen (2011-2013).


== IRIS Conferences ==
In 1978 the IRIS started holding annual conferences and is the oldest consecutive IS conference in the world. The conference is organized as an annual working seminar for Scandinavian researchers and PhD students. After its first few meetings in Finland, the locations now alternate between different Scandinavian countries. Among the subjects discussed at the IRIS conferences is Information and Communications Technology, Business Process Management and Participatory Design. In 2005 IRIS had a Steering Committee the chairman of which was Jan Pries-Heje.
In 2006 Judith Molka-Danielsen, and her associates published a paper that identified the most prolific authors who had successfully submitted papers to IRIS. The top ten researchers were: Lars Mathiassen, Markku Nurminen, Pertti Järvinen, Carsten Sørensen, Per Flensburg, Karl Heinz Kautz, Peter Axel Nielsen, Lars Svensson, Urban Nuldén, and Ole Hanseth.
The next IRIS conference will be held in Oulu, Finland, in August 2015.
