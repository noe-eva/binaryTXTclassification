SCIA, the Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis, is a biennial scientific conference organized by the national pattern recognition societies in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden). The conference is officially sponsored by the International Association of Pattern Recognition which is the international umbrella organization for the national pattern recognition societies. The conference series was established by pattern recognition, image analysis and computer vision pioneers in the universities of the Nordic countries, but has become an international conference acknowledged by the researches in the fields of computer vision, image analysis, pattern recognition and multimedia. Like European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) from Europe and International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (PRIA) from Russia, it is considered an important conference in pattern recognition in Northern and Eastern Europe.
The submitted papers are peer-reviewed using the single-blind practice by 2-3 reviewers and the acceptance ratio is typically between 40-50%. The oral session is a single-track. The conference rotates between the four organizing countries. All accepted articles, both oral and poster, are published in the Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science. The official language of the submissions and the conference is English.
At the conference banquet, the biennial award for the best Scandinavian PhD thesis in the fields of pattern recognition and image analysis is announced.
