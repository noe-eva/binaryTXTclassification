Previously, he was a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the Computing Laboratory of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. He joined the Computing Laboratory in 1964. Before that, since 1951, he was a Senior Scientific Officer at the Naval Construction Research Establishment at Dunfermline.
He has written four books in computer science and combinatorics. His book Comparative Programming Languages was regarded among the major textbooks on programming languages and has received positive reviews since its first edition. This book was translated into French in its second edition. As a researcher, he is best known for his contributions to extensions of the stable marriage problem.
