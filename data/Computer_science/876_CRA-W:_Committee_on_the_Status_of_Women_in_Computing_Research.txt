The Computing Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W)'s mission is to increase the success and participation of women in computing research and education at all levels. In particular, CRA-W focuses on computer science and engineering and tries to make sure their activities have a positive impact on underrepresented groups in these areas. CRA-W is also concerned with improving the success rate of all computer scientists and engineers in the working environment.
