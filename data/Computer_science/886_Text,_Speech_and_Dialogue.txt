Text, Speech and Dialogue (TSD) is an annual conference involving topics on natural language processing and computational linguistics. The meeting is held every September alternating in Brno and Pilsen, Czech Republic.
The first Text, Speech and Dialogue conference took place in Brno in 1998.


== Overview ==
TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in both spoken and written language processing from all over the world. Proceedings of TSD form a book published by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.  TSD Proceedings are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index. Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major citation databases such as DBLP, SCOPUS, EI, INSPEC or COMPENDEX.
The conference is organized by the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen. The conference is supported by International Speech Communication Association.
