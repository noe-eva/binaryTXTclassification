MICAI (short for Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence) is the name of an annual conference covering all areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), held in Mexico. The first MICAI conference was held in 2000. The conference is attended every year by about two hundred of AI researchers and PhD students and 500âˆ’1000 local graduate students.


== Overview ==
MICAI is a high-level peer-reviewed international conference covering all areas of Artificial Intelligence. All editions of MICAI have been published in Springer Springer LNAI (N 1793, 2313, 2972, 3789, 4293, 4827, 5317, 5845, 6437-6438). Recent MICAI events (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010) received over 300 submissions from over 40 countries each. The conference's scientific program includes keynote lectures, paper presentations, tutorials, panels, posters, and workshops. MICAI is organized by the Mexican Society for Artificial Intelligence (SMIA) in cooperation with various national institutions.
Their topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Automated theorem proving, Belief Revision, Bioinformatics and Medical Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Case-Based Reasoning, Common Sense Reasoning, Computer Vision and Image Processing, Constraint Programming, Data Mining, Expert Systems and Knowledge-based systems, Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, Hybrid Intelligent Systems, Intelligent Interfaces: Multimedia, Virtual Reality, Intelligent Organizations, Intelligent tutoring systems, Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Management, Logic Programming, Machine Learning, Model-Based Reasoning, Multiagent Systems and Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, Non-monotonic Reasoning, Ontologies, Pattern Recognition, Philosophical and Methodological Issues of Artificial Intelligence, Planning and Scheduling, Qualitative Reasoning, Robotics, Spatial and Temporal Reasoning, Uncertainty Reasoning and Probabilistic Reasoning.
