Local ternary patterns (LTP) are an extension of Local binary patterns (LBP). Unlike LBP, it does not threshold the pixels into 0 and 1, rather it uses a threshold constant to threshold pixels into three values. Considering k as the threshold constant, c as the value of the center pixel, a neighboring pixel p, the result of threshold is:
  
    
      
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  1
                  ,
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  p
                  >
                  c
                  +
                  k
                
              
              
                
                  0
                  ,
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  p
                  >
                  c
                  −
                  k
                  
                     and 
                  
                  p
                  <
                  c
                  +
                  k
                
              
              
                
                  −
                  1
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  p
                  <
                  c
                  −
                  k
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}1,&{\text{if }}p>c+k\\0,&{\text{if }}p>c-k{\text{ and }}p<c+k\\-1&{\text{if }}p<c-k\\\end{cases}}}
  
In this way, each thresholded pixel has one of the three values. Neighboring pixels are combined after thresholding into a ternary pattern. Computing a histogram of these ternary values will result in a large range, so the ternary pattern is split into two binary patterns. Histograms are concatenated to generate a descriptor double the size of LBP.
