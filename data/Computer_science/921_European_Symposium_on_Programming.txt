The European Symposium on Programming (ESOP) is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems. It is one of the 10 top conferences in Programming Languages.
Initially a biannual conference, ESOP moved in 1998 into an annual schedule and became one of the founding conferences of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS).
