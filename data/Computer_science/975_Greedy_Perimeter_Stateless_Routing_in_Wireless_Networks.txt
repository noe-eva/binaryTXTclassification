The Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing in Wireless Networks is a routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks. It was developed by B. Karp. It uses a greedy algorithm to do the routing and orbits around a perimeter.


== Coordinates instead of receiver names ==
GPSR is a geo routing method, which means that data packages are not sent to a special receiver but to coordinates. The packages should be relayed to the node that's geographically closest to the coordinates. This assumes that every node knows its own position.
