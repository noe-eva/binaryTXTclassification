The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA) annual conference on machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. It is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas, held in UK. Particularly, BMVC is ranked as A2 by Qualis, and B by ERA. The upcoming 27th BMVC will be hosted by Imperial College London in September 2017.
BMVC is a successor of the older British Alvey Vision Conference (AVC), which had run in years 1985 (University of Sussex), 1987 (University of Cambridge), 1988 (University of Manchester) and 1989 (University of Reading). The British Machine Vision Conference has replaced AVC in 1990, when BMVA was founded. Despite starting as a national conference, it is now a prestigious major international venue with high level of foreign participation (in 2013, 84% of accepted papers were completely from outside the UK and another 4% with mixed authorships) and high stress on quality of publications (in 2013, the acceptance rate was only 30%). BMVC is a relatively small conference, with the number of accepted publications (and therefore number of talks and posters) around 100.


== Usual programme ==
BMVC is a single-track conference held usually over the course of one week in early September. On Monday, there are usually one or several tutorials, followed by the main conference in the following three days. A typical conference day consists of a keynote talk, two or three oral sessions and a poster session. Thursday's programme tends to be shorter. The conference usually includes a banquet and a reception. The main conference is followed by a one-day student workshop on Friday, which provides an opportunity for doctoral students to present their work and interact with their peers.


== Awards ==
At BMVC, there are several awards given. Besides the Best Scientific Paper Award (formerly known as Science Prize), there is Best Industrial Paper Award (formerly known as Industry Prize), Best Poster Award and others. The awards recipients are tabulated below. Additionally, other BMVA prizes such as BMVA Distinguished Fellowship or Sullivan Prize are awarded during BMVC.
