1852 in sports describes the year's events in world sport.

Events
21 August — John Morrissey defeats George Thompson in the 11th round at Mare Island, California and claims the Heavyweight Championship of America, which has been vacated by the now-retired Tom Hyer. His claim is not generally recognised at this time because of the prior claim by Yankee Sullivan, who fought Hyer in 1849.
Harry Broome retains the Championship of England but there is no record of any fights involving him in 1851.

Events
Adolf Anderssen and Jean Dufresne play the Evergreen Game in Berlin. Like Anderssen's Immortal Game of the previous year, it is an informal game.
