== Football ==
Events
The original Cambridge University Rules are written by a committee of students, including H. de Winton and J. C. Thring, who are still confused by the different rules operating at the various schools. Besides Rugby, Eton and Harrow there are also rules of a sort in place at Winchester, Shrewsbury and elsewhere. Cambridge is the first attempt at codifying the rules of association football (i.e., the "dribbling" game) as distinct from rugby football (i.e., the "handling" game).
Unfortunately, no copy of these original Cambridge Rules survives.
The essential difference in the two codes is always that association football does not allow a player to run with the ball in his hands or pass it by hand to a colleague. However, the early rules do allow players to touch and control the ball by hand.
