The Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS; English: International Federation of Roller Sports) is the world governing body for roller sports, including skateboarding, rink hockey, inline hockey, speed skating, inline alpine, downhill, roller derby, roller freestyle, inline freestyle and artistic roller skating. It was established in April 1924 in Montreux, Switzerland by two Swiss sportsmen, Fred Renkewitz and Otto Myer, who had close connections to the International Olympic Committee.
The FIRS gathers more than 100 national federations, including countries from every continent and they are affiliated with the International Skating Union. Park terrain skateboarding will become an Olympic sport in 2020.
A proposal to dissolve the federation and merge with the International Skateboarding Federation to form a new body known as World Skate is expected to be ratified in September 2017.
