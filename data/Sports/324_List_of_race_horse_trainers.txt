Race horse trainers train horses for horse racing. This involves exercising, feeding, management and, in early years, to get them used to human contact.
Once a horse is old enough to be ridden, a trainer prepares a horse for races, with responsibility for exercising it, getting it race-ready and determining which races it should enter. Leading horse trainers can earn a great deal of money from a percentage of the winnings that they charge the owner for training the horse.
Outside horse racing, most trainers specialize in a certain equestrianism discipline. Some fields can be very lucrative, usually depending on the value of the horses one trains or prize money available in competition.
