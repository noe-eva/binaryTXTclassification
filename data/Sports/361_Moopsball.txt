Moopsball is a sport created by Gary Cohn. The rules were published in Damon Knight's Orbit series of anthologies (specifically Orbit 18). The game incorporates elements of football and medieval recreationist combat.
Moopsball was at one time part of geek canon, but has over the past years fallen into relative obscurity. The sport was mentioned repeatedly in the Legion of Super-Heroes comics as being one of the most popular sports of the fictional 30th century DC Universe and is the favoured sport of Illuminati University. In the novel There Are Doors by Gene Wolfe, Indoor Moopsball is played by inmates of a psychiatric hospital.
