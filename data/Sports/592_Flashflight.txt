A Flashflight is a flying disc designed to be used for night-time disc games between two or more individuals. The Flashflight differs from traditional discs (including glow-in-the-dark models also intended for nocturnal usage) in that it has a completely enclosed single ultra-high brightness LED and fiber optics designed to distribute light from the center of the disc to the outer rim. The red light (630 nm wavelength) does not interfere with human night vision, and is visible from all disc angles because all disc surfaces are illuminated â€“ the top deck glows, there is a radiant array on the concave underside, and there are nine bright dots on the perimeter of the rim.
Designed in 2002 by University of Colorado at Boulder alumni Jeff Scott and Jerry Moore, the Flashflight (a trademarked brand name) is manufactured via injection molding, using a soft polyethylene. A standard lithium coin-cell battery (CR2430 3 volt or DL2430 3 v) powers the 185-gram, 10.75-inch-diameter (273 mm) disc.
Other Flashflight models include the smaller and softer polyurethane "Mini" and "Junior" versions marketed for children and disc-trained dogs.
