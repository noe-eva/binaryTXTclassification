Przeglad Sportowy (Polish pronunciation: [ˈpʂɛɡlɔnt spɔrˈtɔvɨ], Sports Review) is the oldest and now the only Polish sports daily, founded in 1921 in Kraków. In 1926 it initiated an annual, popular plebiscite for the Polish Sportspersonality of the Year. Its current editor-in-chief is Przemysław Rudzki.
The circulation of the newspaper is of around 100,000 a day, varying between 94,000 and 150,000. It also has a digital presence: the website and various social accounts offer online sport news in Polish. In March 2014, they announced a cooperation with the startup Betegy, providing data-based football predictions in their printed newspaper as well as online.
It was founded in Kraków in 1921; but moved to the capital, Warsaw.
The shareholder of the newspaper is Ringier Axel Springer Media AG, a joint venture between the German publishing company Axel Springer and Ringier, the largest international operating media company in Switzerland.
