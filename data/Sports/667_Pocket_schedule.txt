A pocket schedule or fixtures card is a small card or foldable paper guide which typically fits in a wallet or pocket. It is most often used by sports clubs or their sponsors for marketing purposes, in addition to displaying the team's scheduled matches.
A typical pocket schedule may contain a full season match schedule for the team, venue information, contact information for purchasing tickets, promotional events, and major sponsor advertising. It may also include radio and television broadcast data.
