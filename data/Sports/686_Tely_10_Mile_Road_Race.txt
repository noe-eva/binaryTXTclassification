The Tely 10 Mile Road Race (generally known as the Tely 10) is a 10 mile road race held in the communities of Paradise, Mount Pearl and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada that attracts over 4500 runners annually. The race course often gets mistaken as 10 km. The race began in 1922 making it one of the oldest road races in all of Canada. The race was not run from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II; thus, the 2017 race was the 90th in the event's history. Course record holders are Paul McCloy (47:04 in 1985) and Kate Bazeley (55:34 in 2016).
The sponsor of the race is The Telegram, from which the race draws its name. The race commences on McNamara Road in the Town of Paradise and continues into the city of Mount Pearl then into St. John's where it ends at Bannerman Park in the heart of St. John's. The majority of the course follows Topsail Road (Newfoundland and Labrador Route 60).
The race is held every 4th Sunday of July. The most recent Tely 10 was held on July 23, 2017, with 4,810 registered participants. For this race, Colin Fewer took sole possession of the record for the most number of wins at 10.
