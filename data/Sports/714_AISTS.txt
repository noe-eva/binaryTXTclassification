This understanding will be reinforced through a number of case studies, which offer concrete examples of what leading sports organisations, such as FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Automobile Federation are achieving in this area. Participants will also gain insight into the best practices adopted by the American major leagues such as the NFL, NBA and MLB.
