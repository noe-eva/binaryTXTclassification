A tuilik is a watertight jacket, used when paddling a kayak. It is sealed at the face, at the wrists and around the cockpit coaming. In this way the paddler can capsize and do an eskimo roll to come back upright without getting wet, and without getting any water into his kayak.
Traditionally, a tuilik is made from seal-skin. Modern tuiliks made from neoprene are called tuiliusaq. Tuiliusaqs are warm and stretchy, and provide good insulation against cold weather. Tuiliks are also made from waterproof, breathable fabric similar to that used for rain jackets. Some tuiliks have been made of cotton canvas. Finally, some now use polyurethane laminate fabric, which is less warm than neophrene, but stretchier, less bulky, and more durable.

Traditional tuiliks are narrower, to fit narrow custom-fitted cockpits; mass-produced kayaks have larger cockpits and the tuilik must therefore be wider at the hem.
Many kayakers do not use a tuilik, but instead a separate spray skirt and cag (drysuit jacket). A tuilik integrates the two into one piece of clothing. Tuiliks are generally less restrictive of motion.
The air trapped in a tuilik makes rolling easier. If the paddler comes out of their kayak, a tuilik provides considerable initial buoyancy, and the legs may be drawn up into the air pocket.  PFDs may be worn over or under a tuilik or tuiliusaq.
In summer months, an akuilisaq may be used instead.
