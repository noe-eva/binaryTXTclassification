Virtual Replay is a technology which allows people to see 3D animations of sporting events. The technology was widely used during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. During this event, bbcnews.com posted highlights of the event on their websites soon after matches concluded and users could view the 3D renderings from multiple points of view.
