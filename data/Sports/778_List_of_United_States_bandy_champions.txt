United States bandy champions are the winners of the annual play-offs following the regular league of the Division I in the American Bandy League, the top league for bandy in the United States. The championship trophy is called the Gunnar Cup, named for Gunnar Fast, a Swedish army captain who introduced bandy to the United States around 1980.
