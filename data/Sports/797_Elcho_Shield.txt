The Elcho Shield is an annual match rifle competition between national teams of eight from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. The trophy holder is able to choose the venue of the competition, however, since the NRA's move to Surrey from Wimbledon in the 19th century, the competition has been held at Bisley Ranges, Surrey, England. Each shooter fires fifteen shots at 1,000 yd (910 m), 1,100 yd (1,000 m), and 1,200 yd (1,100 m) with, unusually for a shooting discipline, no "sighting" or practice shots. The shooters may be coached which allows other team members to judge and make necessary adjustments to the shooter's sights. The rules allow each team two hours at each range to fire all their shots. The match is most regularly held following the national championships in July each year.
The first match, on Wednesday July 9th 1862, was held over 800 yd (730 m), 900 yd (820 m) and 1,000 yd (910 m) solely between Scotland and England. In the event England won by 166 marks. Scotland won the trophy for the first time in 1864 and Ireland joined the fray in 1865.
The trophy is large and distinctive, known as the Elcho Shield, and is made from a sheet of iron decorated with repousse scenes to a design by the artist G. F. Watts. It was presented to the National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom by its founder and president, Lord Elcho (Francis Richard Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss and 6th Earl of March, b. 1818, d. 1914).
The current holder of the trophy is England (2017).
