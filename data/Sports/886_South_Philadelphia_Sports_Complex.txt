The South Philadelphia Sports Complex is the current home of Philadelphia's professional sports teams, located in the South Philadelphia section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is the site of the Wells Fargo Center, Lincoln Financial Field, Citizens Bank Park, and the retail/entertainment center Xfinity Live!.


== History ==
The South Philadelphia Sports Complex was also once home to John F. Kennedy Stadium, Veterans Stadium and the Spectrum. Prior to its development, it was a shanty town known as "The Neck" of the undeveloped League Island area, formerly Passyunk Township. Oregon Avenue was the southern border end of the city up to the 1920s.
In 1926 the City selected the area south of Oregon Avenue for the 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition and developed the large river delta land south of Oregon Avenue. South Broad Street was a grand European-styled boulevard surrounded by massive exhibit buildings and structures that were to be a testament to American science, culture, and progress for the future. Following the close of the celebration of this 150 years of American Independence on the Avenue of the Colonies of South Broad Street came quick total demolition except of the stadium.
Prior to building Veterans Stadium across Packer Avenue north of JFK Stadium was family entertainment of a bowling alley, and a drive-in theater that was a venue created by Camden, New Jersey, chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead, Jr., whose family owned and operated the R.M. Hollingshead Corporation chemical plant in Camden and that peaked in popularity in the 1950s and 1960s.

John F. Kennedy Stadium: JFK Stadium opened in 1926 as Sesquicentennial Stadium for the Sesquicentennial Exposition, and was renamed Philadelphia Municipal Stadium following the Exposition. The name was again changed in 1964 in honor of President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated on November 22, 1963. JFK Stadium was condemned in 1989 and demolished in 1992. JFK was home to the Eagles, the Philadelphia Quakers of the first American Football League, the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League, and 42 Army–Navy Games. It was also one of the host sites for the original Live Aid concert in 1985, and the Jacksons Victory Tour in September, 1984.

Aquarama Aquarium Theater of the Sea: existed between 1962 through 1969. It was located at 3200 South Broad Street bordering the Packer Park residential neighborhood in South Philadelphia. It was the successor to the Philadelphia Aquarium, established in the City of Philadelphia and built in 1911 along the Schuylkill River northwest of the Parkway's Art Museum in Center City. The relocated aquarium was augmented by elements of family fun exhibits and aquatic shows. The new public spaces hosted popular teen dances, and became an identifiable part of South Philadelphia's pop culture scene during the 1950s and 1960s with disc jockeys like Ed Hurst, Jerry Blavat and Dick Clark of American Bandstand garnering significant attention. After its demolition, movie theater and fast-food hamburger chain, the "Steer-in", were built on the site, which would be demolished in the 1990s to make way for new residential and commercial development.
