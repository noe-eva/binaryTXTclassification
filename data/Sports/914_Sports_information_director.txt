A sports information director is a type of public relations worker who provides statistics, team and player notes and other information about a college or university's sports teams to the news media and general public. Abbreviated "SID," sports information directors often have varying titles, such as media relations director and communications director.
SIDs are generally responsible for a number of external publicity efforts by an athletic department. This ranges from updating and maintaining the content on the school's athletic website and social media accounts to statistics management to historical records keeping. SIDs also are often responsible for the production of official publications, most notable media guides, game notes and game programs. Media guides are used both as a resource for the news media and as a recruiting piece for the individual teams.
Sports information directors and their staff also serve as the athletic department liaison to media, including serving as the first point of contact, the athletic department spokesperson and crisis management personnel.
The College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) provides an organizational structure for SID's at all collegiate levels in the United States and Canada. The organization has named Academic All-Americans since 1952. CoSIDA also provides career resources for potential SIDs such as job postings and résumé exchanges.
