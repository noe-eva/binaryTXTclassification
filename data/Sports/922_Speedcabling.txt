Speedcabling has been described as a competitive sport, which originated in the United States and was devised by Steven Schkolne. In the standard rules, competitors are challenged to separate a mass of either six or twelve tangled Cat 5 Ethernet cables in the fastest possible time. There are either two or four each of red 7-foot, blue 14-foot, and yellow 21-foot cables. According to the competition regulations, the cables are tangled by forming a figure-eight and placing them in a clothes dryer on high heat for three minutes. They are then allowed to cool. Schkolne says this allows them to achieve a "natural" entanglement.

The first speedcabling competition took place at the Machine Project art gallery in Los Angeles, California, and was won by local web developer Matty Howell. His prize was a $50 gift certificate for dinner at an Italian restaurant.
