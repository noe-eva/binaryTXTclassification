Nakukymppi is a nude sport event in Finland, held in the municipality of Padasjoki one week before Midsummer every year.
The idea is to run or walk 10 kilometres naked. Participants wear only shoes, socks and headwear. Women wear a top if their breasts are shaking too much. It has been held annually since 2003. It usually draws about 40 to 50 participants, of which one-tenth to one-fifth are women. Even though the event isn't organised by naturists and not only for naturists, half of the participants are naturists.
The event is organized by Mr. Aarne Heino together with local village community.
