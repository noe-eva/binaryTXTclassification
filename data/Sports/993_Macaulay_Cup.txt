The MacAulay Association Camanachd Cup is a trophy in the Scottish sport of shinty. It is competed for by the eight highest-placed league teams from the north and south areas of Scotland at the end of the previous season. The first winner of the cup, in 1947, was Newtonmore. It will be sponsored by Artemis from the 2010 season.[1] It is one of the five trophies considered to be part of the Grand Slam in the sport of shinty.
The current holders are Kyles Athletic, who have won it 12 times.


== History ==
The MacAulay Cup was first presented in 1947 by Flora Macaulay, then editor of The Oban Times newspaper. The competition, uniquely in the sport is run outwith the auspices of the Camanachd Association, being administered by the Macaulay Association which also runs a junior six a-side competition before the final.
The final is played in Oban every year. It was the first ever summer tournament when shinty had a winter season, before the switch to summer play in 2004. In 2006, worries about the fixture list being overcrowded led to the proposal of the Macaulay Cup becoming a match between the winners of the Mactavish Cup and the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup. The Macaulay Association withdrew the cup from competition but the reintroduction of the competition in 2007 sparked debate about its place in the sport.[2]
Inveraray won the cup 3-0 against Newtonmore on August 23, 2008. The game was televised live on BBC2. Inveraray again won the cup in 2009 coming back from 3-0 down to win the game 4-3 with a last minute goal by Grant Griffin.
Kingussie stopped Inveraray's attempt at a third consecutive title with a 4-2 win after extra time on 21 August 2010 thanks to 4 goals from Ronald Ross.[3]
The top 8 in the south for 2012 was affected by Ballachulish's decision to drop a league, they were the eighth best team in the south (not counting Lochside Rovers) in 2011.
The 2012 final was played between Oban and Glenurquhart. [4] Glen defeated Oban 6-0. In the aftermath of the final, the trophy was broken during celebrations.[5]
Kingussie are the record holders with 23 wins, but Kyles Athletic moved into second place on the all time charts with 12 after beating Newtonmore with whom they were tied in the 2017 final.
