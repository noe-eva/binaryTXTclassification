In metadata a synonym ring or synset, is a group of data elements that are considered semantically equivalent for the purposes of information retrieval. These data elements are frequently found in different metadata registries. Although a group of terms can be considered equivalent, metadata registries store the synonyms at a central location called the preferred data element.
According to WordNet, a synset or synonym set is defined as a set of one or more synonyms that are interchangeable in some context without changing the truth value of the proposition in which they are embedded.


== Example ==
The following are considered semantically equivalent and form a synonym ring:

foaf:person
gjxdm:Person
niem:Person
sumo:Human
cyc:Person
umbel:Person

Note that each data element has two components:
Namespace prefix, which is a shorthand for the name of the metadata registry
Data element name, which is the name of the object in each of the distinct metadata registry


== Expressing a synonym ring ==
A synonym ring can be expressed by a series of statements in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) using the classEquivalence or the propertyEquivalence or instance equivalence statement - the sameAs property.
