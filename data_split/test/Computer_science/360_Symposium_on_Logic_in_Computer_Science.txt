The ACM–IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) is an annual academic conference on the theory and practice of computer science in relation to mathematical logic. Extended versions of selected papers of each year's conference appear in renowned international journals such as Logical Methods in Computer Science and ACM Transactions on Computational Logic.


== History ==
LICS was originally sponsored solely by the IEEE, but as of the 2014 founding of the ACM Special Interest Group on Logic and Computation LICS has become the flagship conference of SIGLOG, under the joint sponsorship of ACM and IEEE.
Since the first installment in 1988, the cover page of the conference proceedings has featured an artwork entitled Irrational Tiling by Logical Quantifiers, by Alvy Ray Smith.
Since 1995, each year the Kleene award is given to the best student paper. In addition, since 2006, the LICS Test-of-Time Award is given annually to one among the twenty-year-old LICS papers that have best met the test of time.
