The Pattern Oriented Rule Implementation (PORI) table is a data structure invented by Amdocs for representation of algorithms for determining a price or set of prices in a financial transaction. The PORI table is used to describe the pricing logic associated with the input event. The PORI table enables business analysts to build a language to describe the business logic associated with financial pricing. The pricing logic is composed without the need for programming, and transformed into executable code using the PORI Core Processor execution engine. The unique PORI representation, and the inference engine for executing the PORI rules, is used to compute a variety of pricing problems on the input event in real-time fashion.
