An RRQR factorization or rank-revealing QR factorization is a matrix decomposition algorithm based on the QR factorization which can be used to determine the rank of a matrix. The SVD can be used to generate an RRQR, but it is not an efficient method to do so. A RRQR implementation is available for MATLAB.
