Fanya S. Montalvo (born in Monterrey, Mexico) Received the Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science  at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1976. Her dissertation was entitled Aftereffects, Adaptation, and Plasticity: A Neural Model for Tunable Feature Space. She was advised by Michael Anthony Arbib. Montalvo has been a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, HP, MIT, and Digital Equipment Corporation.
Montalvo is a leader in the field of Inconsistency Robustness currently serving on the governing Board of the International Society for Inconsistency Robustness. According to Rosalind Picard, she is involved in considerations within emotional computing.[see: Affective Computing ] She is known for having coined the term "AI-complete" to denote an Artificial Intelligence task that is equivalent in difficulty to that of solving the problem of Strong AI.
