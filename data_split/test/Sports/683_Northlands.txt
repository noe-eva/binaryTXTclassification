Northlands is a non-profit, volunteer organization in Edmonton, Alberta. It was founded in 1879, before the official incorporation of the city of Edmonton, or the province of Alberta.
Northlands attracts over 4 million visitors every year to more than 2,500 events, including Canadian Finals Rodeo, Farmfair International, K-Days, headliner concerts, international events, trade shows, live horse racing and slot machines.
