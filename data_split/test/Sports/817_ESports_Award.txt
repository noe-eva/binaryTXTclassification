The eSports Award was an annual award ceremony held from 2004 to 2011 by Turtle Entertainment in which individuals, teams and organisations are recognized in several categories for their contribution or achievements to or in the field of competitive gaming. Most awards ceased in 2009, but the remaining Journalist Award category has became the main award for the next two years.
The event was traditionally held at a major gaming event in Germany. The winner of each category was determined by either a panel of experts or an online popularity vote. Each year's nominees were announced mid-July.
Active categories were:


== Journalists Award ==
The eSports Journalist Award was initially a category of the eSports Awards, but in 2009 became the main focus of the award-giving ceremony. The eSports Journalist Award was bestowed to journalists, members of the press, editors and press volunteers who write unique, different and detailed articles about eSports and its subtopics.
According to the official website of the eSports Journalist Award, writers for the eSports scene were not eligible for the award since their content is generally directed to the community of gamers while journalists write for the general public, raising awareness and delivering information unto people who aren't as knowleadgeable as eSports community members.
