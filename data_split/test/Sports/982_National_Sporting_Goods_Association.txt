== Summary ==
The National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA) is a non-profit trade association that provides information to and advocates for the sporting goods industry. NSGA members include retailers, institutional team dealers, wholesalers, manufacturers and industry associates.


== History ==
The National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA) has worked on behalf of retailers and dealers since the association’s founders fought an unjust tax on sporting goods in 1927. South Carolina’s General Assembly had approved a 10 percent tax on retail sales of sporting goods in ’27, and this so enraged the state’s sporting goods dealers that they formed the Sporting Goods Dealer’s Association of South Carolina to urge repeal of the tax. One year later, they accomplished their goal.
Soon after, other regional sporting goods associations began to form. Ultimately, at a meeting in January 1929, in New York City, East Coast sporting goods distributors banded together to form the Athletic Goods Wholesalers Association. Two months later in St. Louis, Mo., Midwestern and Southern sporting goods dealers formed the Sporting Goods Distributors Association.
It wasn’t long before the two regional organizations met in Cleveland, Ohio; the result of this meeting was the merging of the two associations. On May 26, 1929, the Sporting Goods Distributors Association was born. In 1930, the name was changed to the National Sporting Goods Distributors Association. Finally, in 1936, the organization adopted the name National Sporting Goods Association.

NSGA membership consists of retailers, institutional team dealers and also includes wholesalers, manufacturer, sales agents and industry associates in the sporting goods industry.

NSGA publishes the NSGA Scoreboard, an enewsletter that goes out twice a month on Tuesday. This enewsletter combines all of the news in the industry and also shares news on NSGA research, team rule changes and news and NSGA services and programs. In addition, "HockeyVoice" serves specialty hockey retailers who are members of the Hockey Dealers Association (HDA), a division of NSGA.

The Division acts as a liaison with rule-making bodies and with national high school and college federations. A Team Dealer Advisory Committee provides guidance and feedback to NSGA staff on issues important to team dealers.
NSGA divisions created in 2010 include the Hockey Dealers Association (HDA), which serves the hockey industry. In addition, NSGA created its Division for Sales Agents, which serves sales agencies, independent sales agents and company sales representatives in the many segments of the Sporting Goods Industry.
