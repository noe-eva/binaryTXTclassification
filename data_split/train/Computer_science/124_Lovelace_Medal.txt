The Lovelace Medal, established by the British Computer Society in 1998, is presented to individuals who have advanced Information Systems or added significantly to their understanding.
The award is named after Ada Lovelace, who corresponded with computer pioneer Charles Babbage and is often described as the world's first computer programmer.
The medal is intended to be presented to individuals who have made a contribution which is of major significance in the advancement of Information Systems or which adds significantly to the understanding of Information Systems in industry, academia, technical or managerial domains. It is generally anticipated that there will be one medalist each year, but the regulation does not preclude either several medalists or no medalist.
