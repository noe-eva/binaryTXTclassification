OpenSym is a shorthand for International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration, formerly WikiSym or the Wiki Symposium, a conference dedicated to wiki research and practice. In 2014, the name of the conference was changed from WikiSym to OpenSym to reflect a broadening of scope from wiki and Wikipedia research and practice to open collaboration research, including wikis and Wikipedia research, but also free/libre/open source, open data, etc. research. Its proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library.
