The Bachelor of Computer Science or Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (abbreviated BCompSc or BCS or BS CS or B.Sc. CS) is a type of bachelor's degree, usually awarded after three or four years of collegiate study in computer science, but possibly awarded in fewer years depending on factors such as an institution's course requirements and academic calendar. In some cases it can be awarded in five years. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.
The same core curriculum may, depending on the school, result in other degrees, including:
Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science
Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Science
Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech)
Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science
Bachelor of Engineering (BEng or BE) in Computer Science
Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science
Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Computer Science) - BSE (CS)
Bachelor of Computer Security in Computer Science
Bachelor of Science (BSc or BS) in Computer Science (BSc CS or BSCS or BSc (Comp)
In many post-secondary institutions, an Honors Bachelor of Computer Science degree has been introduced as an upgrade to the regular bachelor's program and usually requires at least one additional year of study.


== Typical requirements ==
Because computer science is a wide field, courses required to earn a bachelor of computer science degree vary. A typical list of course requirements includes topics such as:
Computer programming
Programming paradigms
Algorithms
Data structures
Logic & Computation
Computer architecture
Some schools may place more emphasis on mathematics and require additional courses such as:
Linear algebra
Calculus
Probability theory and statistics
Combinatorics and discrete mathematics
Differential calculus and maths
Beyond the basic set of computer science courses, students can typically choose additional courses from a variety of different fields, such as:
Theory of computation
Operating systems
Numerical computation
Compilers, compiler design
Real-time computing
Distributed systems
Computer networking
Data communication
Computer graphics
Artificial intelligence
Human-computer interaction
Information theory
Software testing
Information assurance
Some schools allow students to specialize in a certain area of computer science.
