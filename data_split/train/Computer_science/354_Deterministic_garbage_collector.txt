A deterministic garbage collector is a garbage collector optimized to ensure extremely short pause times and limit the total number of those pauses within a prescribed window. In real time applications, stringent requirements are placed on transaction latency (e.g. "application must respond to a request in 10 ms"). Using an ordinary garbage collector can cause unpredictable behavior of these applications, because a garbage collection operation can start at any time and can consume large amount of resources. One of the possible solutions of this problem is to use a deterministic garbage collector.
