In computing, a multi-way tree or rose tree is a tree data structure with a variable and unbounded number of branches per node. The name rose tree for this structure is prevalent in the functional programming community, e.g., in the context of the Birdâ€“Meertens formalism. It was coined by Lambert Meertens to evoke the similarly-named, and similarly-structured, common rhododendron.
