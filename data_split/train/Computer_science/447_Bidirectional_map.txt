In computer science, a bidirectional map, or hash bag, is an associative data structure in which the 
  
    
      
        (
        k
        e
        y
        ,
        v
        a
        l
        u
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (key,value)}
   pairs form a one-to-one correspondence. Thus the binary relation is functional in each direction: 
  
    
      
        v
        a
        l
        u
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle value}
   can also act as a key to 
  
    
      
        k
        e
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle key}
  . A pair 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a,b)}
   thus provides a unique coupling between 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   so that 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   can be found when 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is used as a key and 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   can be found when 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   is used as a key.
