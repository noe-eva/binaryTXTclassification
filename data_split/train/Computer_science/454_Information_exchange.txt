Information exchange is an informal term that can either refer to bidirectional information transmission/information transfer in telecommunications and computer science or communication seen from a system-theoretic or information-theoretic point of view. As "information" in this context invariably refers to (electronic) data that encodes and represents the information at hand, a broader treatment can be found under data exchange.


== Non-technical meaning ==
Information exchange is also used to describe the process of learning and the efficiency of the learning.
