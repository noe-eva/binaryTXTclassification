Services now account for more than half of the U.S. economy. Services Computing, as a new cross discipline, addresses how to enable IT technology to help people perform business services more efficiently and effectively. At the core of a business model is a set of processes that jointly help yield a profit in an organization. As we can see, services computing currently shapes the thinking of business modeling, business consulting, solution creation, service delivery, and software architecture design, development, and deployment. The global nature of Services Computing leads to many opportunities and few challenges and creates a new networked economic structure for supporting different business models.
The International Conference on Services Computing (SCC) has the following three major research tracks: Foundations of Services Computing, Services-Centric Business Models, and Business Process Integration and Management. Building on its great success of SCC 2004, SCC 2005, and SCC 2006; the 2007 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2007) continues to bridge the gap between Services Computing and Business models with an emerging suite of ground-breaking technology that includes service-oriented architecture, business process integration and management, grid/utility/autonomic computing, and Web 2.0. The theme of SCC 2007 is "Services: Science, Technology, and Business". From technology foundation perspective, Services Computing has become the default discipline for the emerging modern services science.
