ACM Multimedia (ACM-MM) is the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)'s annual conference on multimedia, sponsored by the SIGMM special interest group on multimedia in the ACM. SIGMM specializes in the field of multimedia computing, from underlying technologies to applications, theory to practice, and servers to networks to devices.
In 2003, the conference was given an "Estimated impact factor" of 1.22 by CiteSeer, placing it in the top 15% of computer science publication venues. In 2006 the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia awarded it an 'A+' ranking for conferences attended by Australian academics and in 2012 it received an 'A1' rating from the Brazilian ministry of education.
