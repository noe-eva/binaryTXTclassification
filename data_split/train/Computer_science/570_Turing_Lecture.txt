The BCS / IET Turing Lecture is a prestigious annual lecture given by a noted speaker on the subject of Computer Science. The lecture is delivered in four different locations: The Royal Institution in London, Cardiff University, The University of Manchester and Belfast City Hall / University of Glasgow.
The lecture is named in honour of Alan Turing, and is co-hosted by the British Computer Society (BCS) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). The event should not be confused with the Turing Award lecture organised by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Recent Turing lectures are available as a live webcast and archived online.
