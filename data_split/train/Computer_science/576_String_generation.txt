In computer science, string generation is the process of creating a set of strings from a collection of rules. This is an opposite process to that of parsing, which recognises a string based on some collection of rules.
Applications of string generation include test data generation, Captchas and random essay generation.


== Generation methods ==
Methods for generating strings include:
While a deterministic finite automaton is often used to recognize strings it can easily be changed to generate strings.


== Unsolved problems ==
Unsolved problems in string generation include:

Note; It is an undecidable problem to decide whether a given string can be generated by a given W-grammar.
