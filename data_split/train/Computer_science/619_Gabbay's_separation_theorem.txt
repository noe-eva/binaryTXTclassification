In mathematical logic and computer science, Gabbay's separation theorem, named after Dov Gabbay, states that any arbitrary temporal logic formula can be rewritten in a logically equivalent "past â†’ future" form. I.e. the future becomes what must be satisfied. This form can be used as execution rules; a MetateM program is a set of such rules.
