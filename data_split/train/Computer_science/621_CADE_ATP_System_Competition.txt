The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) is a yearly competition of fully automated theorem provers for classical first order logic. CASC is associated with the Conference on Automated Deduction and the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning organized by the Association for Automated Reasoning.
The first CASC, CASC-13, was held as part of the 13th Conference on Automated Deduction at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, in 1996.
