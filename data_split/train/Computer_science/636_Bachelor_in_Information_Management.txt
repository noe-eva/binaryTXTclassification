== Post Graduate Programs ==
Keep in mind that although you can start a career straight after your bachelors, you may also be interested in furthering your study by enrolling in a masters program. Employers seem to be finding that business management undergraduates are too keen on starting work immediately, without actually having attained the essential skills need for a professional workplace. This may be in terms of general maturity and also the students ability to 'hit the ground running'. This is where masters students have the greater advantage.
There are many different masters programs available to graduates from an Information Management degree. However at this point, the studies tend to narrow down to more specific areas. As you have a solid background in both Business Management and IT, you have a large range to choose from.
If after studying you seem to be more keen in IT then perhaps you should consider doing a masters in either computer science or information systems.These two programs are some of the best for finding postgraduate jobs with high earning salaries.


== Student life ==
Information Management students enrolled in a full-time degree generally have 8â€“13 hours a week in class, whether its lectures, tutorials, or seminars. However time must be spend outside of class working on coursework and assignments as well as doing prerequisite readings for certain modules.
One of the hardest parts about being a student is learning how to survive on a budget. To compensate for this, many students choose to get a part-time job while studying. In the United States, about 50% of students have a part-time job whilst enrolled in a full-time degree. However it becomes increasing difficult to balance a part-time job along with course work, classes, good grades, self study time, and social life. Often self study time suffers the most from part-time jobs. Therefore it would be recommended to work no more than 10 hours a week.
