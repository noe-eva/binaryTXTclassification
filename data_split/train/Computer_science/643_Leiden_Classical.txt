Leiden Classical is a distributed computing project run by the Theoretical Chemistry Department of the Leiden Institute of Chemistry at Leiden University. Leiden Classical is part of the BOINC system, and enables scientists or science students to submit their own test simulations of various molecules and atoms in a classical mechanics environment. ClassicalDynamics is a program (and with it a library) completely written in C++. The library is covered by the LGPL license and the main program is covered by the GPL.


== Joining the project ==
Participation is possible via the BOINC manager. Using this software one can create an account in the project. Then someone can make a model of a dynamic system and simulation participating run. There are several models possible, to interactions between molecules or planets.


== User Submitted Calculations ==
To create a personal calculation, your model must have 6 defined variables:
Colors of your molecules
Box in which the model is run
Number of particles in the simulation
Interaction between the particles
Gravity
Coulomb force
Lennard-Jones interaction
Morse interaction
Rydberg interaction
Harmonic spirit
Harmonic bending
Recurrent torsion interactions

Distance conditions
Confirmation parameter(s)
