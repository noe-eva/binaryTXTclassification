A polylogarithmic function in n is a polynomial in the logarithm of n,

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            k
          
        
        (
        log
        ⁡
        n
        
          )
          
            k
          
        
        +
        ⋯
        +
        
          a
          
            1
          
        
        (
        log
        ⁡
        n
        )
        +
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{k}(\log n)^{k}+\cdots +a_{1}(\log n)+a_{0}.}
  
In computer science, polylogarithmic functions occur as the order of time or memory used by some algorithms (e.g., "it has polylogarithmic order").
All polylogarithmic functions of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   are 
  
    
      
        o
        (
        
          n
          
            ε
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle o(n^{\varepsilon })}
   for every exponent ε > 0 (for the meaning of this symbol, see small o notation), that is, a polylogarithmic function grows more slowly than any positive exponent. This observation is the basis for the soft O notation Õ(n).
