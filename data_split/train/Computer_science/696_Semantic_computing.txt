Semantic computing is a field of computing that combines elements of semantic analysis, natural language processing, data mining and related fields.
Semantic computing addresses three core problems:
Understanding the (possibly naturally-expressed) intentions (semantics) of users and expressing them in a machine-processable format
Understanding the meanings (semantics) of computational content (of various sorts, including, but is not limited to, text, video, audio, process, network, software and hardware) and expressing them in a machine-processable format
Mapping the semantics of user with that of content for the purpose of content retrieval, management, creation, etc.
The IEEE has held an International Conference on Semantic Computing since 2007.
