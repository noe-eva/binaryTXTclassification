=== The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing ===
Kahn, David (1967). The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing. New York: The Macmillan Company. ISBN 0-684-83130-9. 
Description: Almost nothing had been published in cryptography in several decades and very few non-government researchers were thinking about it. The Codebreakers, a popular and non academic book, made many more people aware and contains a lot of technical information, although it requires careful reading to extract it. Its 1967 appearance was followed by the appearance of many papers over the next few years.

Description: Information theory based analysis of cryptography. The original form of this paper was a confidential Bell Labs report from 1945, not the one published.


=== Probabilistic Encryption ===
Goldwasser, Shafi; Micali, Silvio (April 1984). "Probabilistic Encryption" (PDF). Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences. 28 (2): 270–299. doi:10.1016/0022-0000(84)90070-9. 
Description: The paper provides a rigorous basis to encryption (e.g., partial information) and shows that it possible to equate the slightest cryptanalysis to solve a pure math problem. Second, it introduces the notion of computational indistinguishability.

Goldreich, O.; Micali, S.; Wigderson, A. (July 1991). "Proofs that yield nothing but their validity or all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems" (PDF). Journal of the ACM. 38 (3): 690–728. doi:10.1145/116825.116852. 
Description: This paper explains how to construct a zero-knowledge proof system for any language in NP.


== Private Key Cryptography ==


=== Cryptographic Coding for Data-Bank Privacy ===
Feistel, Horst (18 March 1970). "Cryptographic Coding for Data-Bank Privacy". IBM Research Report 2827. 
Description: Feistel ciphers are a form of cipher of which DES is the most important. It would be hard to overestimate the importance of either Feistel or DES. Feistel pushed a transition from stream ciphers to block ciphers. Although most ciphers operate on streams, most of the important ciphers today are block ciphers at their core.


=== Data Encryption Standard ===
NBS Federal Standard FIPS PUB 46, 15 Jan 1977.
Description: DES is not only one of the most widely deployed ciphers in the world but has had a profound impact on the development of cryptography. Roughly a generation of cryptographers devoted much of their time to attacking and improving DES.


== Public Key Cryptography ==


=== New directions in cryptography ===
Diffie, W.; Hellman, M. (1976). "New directions in cryptography" (PDF). IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. 22 (6): 644–654. doi:10.1109/TIT.1976.1055638. 
Description: This paper suggested public key cryptography and presented Diffie-Hellman key exchange. For more information about this work see: W.Diffie, M.E.Hellman, "Privacy and Authentication: An Introduction to Cryptography", in Proc. IEEE, Vol 67(3) Mar 1979, pp 397–427.


=== On the Signature Reblocking Problem in Public Key Cryptography ===
Kohnfelder, Loren M. (1978). "On the Signature Reblocking Problem in Public Key Cryptography". Communications of the ACM. 21 (2): 179. 
Description: In this paper (along with Loren M. Kohnfelder,"Using Certificates for Key Distribution in a Public-Key Cryptosystem", MIT Technical report 19 May 1978), Kohnfelder introduced certificates (signed messages containing public keys) which are the heart of all modern key management systems.

Description: This paper introduced a branch of public key cryptography, known as public key distribution systems. Merkle's work predated "New directions in cryptography" though it was published after it. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is an implementation of such a Merkle system. Hellman himself has argued that a more correct name would be Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.
