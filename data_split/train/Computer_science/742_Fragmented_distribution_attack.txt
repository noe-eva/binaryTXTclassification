Fragmented distribution attack in computer security is a malware or virus distribution technique aiming at bypassing protection systems by sending fragments of code over the network.
This technique has been first described in a paper published on Virus Bulletin 2009 annual conference by Anoirel Issa, malware Analyst for the Symantec Hosted Services, formerly MessageLabs.


== Method of attack ==
A malware is split into several fragments and are embedded in an innocent file, and these segments are sent over a protected network. The fragmented malware successfully bypasses firewalls, IDS and anti-virus undetected, then is re-assembled on victim's system. The re-assembler is a separate program, which is not necessarily a malware thus can evade security measures, locates malware fragment carriers and pre-assemble the malware in memory. The re-assembler may write the code to disk then executes the re-assembled code on either in memory or on disk.


== Consequences ==
If successfully achieved, an FDA attack can result to some serious consequences depends on the victim's level of protection. Consequence not easily predictable but can lead to:
Data, intellectual property leakage
Government, military, industrial espionage
Irreversible financial losses
