In mathematical optimization, the fundamental theorem of linear programming states, in a weak formulation, that the maxima and minima of a linear function over a convex polygonal region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the line segment between them.


== Statement ==
Consider the optimization problem

  
    
      
        min
        
          c
          
            T
          
        
        x
        
           subject to 
        
        x
        ∈
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle \min c^{T}x{\text{ subject to }}x\in P}
  
Where 
  
    
      
        P
        =
        {
        x
        ∈

    {\displaystyle P=\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}:Ax\leq b\}}
  . If 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and

            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}
   is an optimal solution to the problem, then

            ∗

        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  , or lies on a face 
  
    
      
        F
        ⊂
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle F\subset P}
   of optimal solutions.


== Proof ==
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that

          n
          t
        
        (
        P
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\ast }\in \mathrm {int} (P)}
  . Then there exists some 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon >0}
   such that the ball of radius

            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}
   is contained in 
  
    
      
        P
