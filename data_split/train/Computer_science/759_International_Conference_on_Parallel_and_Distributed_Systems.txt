The International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS) is an academic conference sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry around the world to advance the theories, technologies, and applications of parallel and distributed systems.
The ICPADS was an international conference launched in 1992 by the computer science and engineering community in Taiwan in cooperation with the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) and Technical Committee on Distributed Processing (TCDP) of the IEEE Computer Society. Later it was sponsored by computer communities in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea and held the conference annually in these countries. Since 1998, the ICPADS has been sponsored by the TCPP and TCDP of the IEEE Computer Society. ICPADS 2004 is the first ICPADS held outside the East Asia region. Professor Wen-Tsuen Chen of the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan served as the founding General Chairman of ICPADS 1992. He had been the Steering Committee Chairman of the ICPADS since 1992 until he was succeeded by Professor Nionel M. Ni of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2008.
