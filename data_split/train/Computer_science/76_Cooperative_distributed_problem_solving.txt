In computing cooperative distributed problem solving is a network of semi-autonomous processing nodes working together to solve a problem, typically in a multi-agent system. That is concerned with the investigation of problem subdivision, sub-problem distribution, results synthesis, optimisation of problem solver coherence and co-ordination. It is closely related to distributed constraint programming and distributed constraint optimization; see the links below.


== Aspects of CDPS ==
Neither global control or global data storage â€“ no individual CDPS problem solver (agent) has sufficient information to solve the entire problem.
Control and data are distributed
Communication is slower than computation, therefore:
Loose coupling between problem solvers
Efficient protocols (not too much communication overhead)
problems should be modular, coarse grained

Any unique node is a potential bottleneck
Organised behaviour is hard to guarantee since no one node has the complete picture
