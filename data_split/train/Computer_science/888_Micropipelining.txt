In computer science, micropipelining is the finest level of pipelining. Very few pipelined processors are designed to exceed 10 stages in real computers. However, the coarse level for pipeline stages can be conducted at the processor level, which is referred to as macropipelining. The number of stages being used in a pipeline often depends on the tradeâ€”off between performance and cost. The optimal choice for such a number can be determined by obtaining the peak value of a performance/cost ratio (PCR).
