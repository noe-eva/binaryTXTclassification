The term "biological computation" refers, variously, to any of the following:
- the study of the computations performed by natural biota, including the subject matter of systems biology.
- the design of algorithms inspired by the computational methods of biota 
- the design and engineering of manufactured computational devices using synthetic biology components
- computer methods for the analysis of biological data, elsewhere called computational biology
When biological computation refers to using biology to build computers, it is a subfield of computer science and is distinct from the interdisciplinary science of bioinformatics which simply uses computers to better understand biology.
