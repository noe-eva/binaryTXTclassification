In co-simulation the different subsystems which form a coupled problem are modeled and simulated in a distributed manner. Hence, the modeling is done on the subsystem level without having the coupled problem in mind. Furthermore, the coupled simulation is carried out by running the subsystems in a black-box manner. During the simulation the subsystems will exchange data.


== Problem Partitioning - From Monolithic to Co-Simulation ==
The partitioning procedure identifies the process of spatial separation of the coupled problem into multiple partitioned subsystems.


== Communication Patterns ==


=== Gauss-Seidel (serial) ===


=== Jacobi (parallel) ===


== Problem Decomposition ==
The term decomposition is used for the process of defining the input/output relations for each individual subsystem.


== Coupling Algorithms ==


=== Loose ===


=== Iterative ===


== Software realization ==


=== Functional Mock-up Interface ===
For signals co-simulation can be performed with a standardized interface called Functional Mock-up Interface.


=== Agent-based model ===
Agent-based model is a modeling approach of complex systems. Each simulator is seen as an agent and "behaves" according to its associated simulator. The agents interact, exchange data, between each other in a network. The simulation environment Mecysco is an implementation of this approach [1]
