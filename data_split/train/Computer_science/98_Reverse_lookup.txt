Reverse lookup is the act of using a value to retrieve a unique key in an associative array.
Applications of reverse lookup include reverse DNS lookup, which provides the domain name associated with a particular IP address, and a reverse telephone directory, which provides the name of the entity associated with a particular telephone number.
