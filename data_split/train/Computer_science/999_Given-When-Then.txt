Given-When-Then or GWT is a semi-structured way to write down test cases. They can either be tested manually or automated as browser tests with Selenium.
It derives its name from the three clauses used, which start with the words GIVEN, WHEN and THEN.
The Given-When-Then was invented by Dan North as part of behavior-driven development.
