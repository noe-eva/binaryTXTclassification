International
30 November — Scotland v. England in Glasgow is the first–ever official football international. The match is a goalless draw.
England
16 March — inaugural FA Cup final. The Wanderers 1–0 Royal Engineers at Kennington Oval in London. The goal is scored by Morton Betts. In its way, this first final marks the beginning of major competitive football.
The FA rules that the ball must have a circumference of between 68 cm and 71 cm. It must be spherical and must consist of an India rubber bladder enclosed within a casing made of leather or another approved material. Also, the ball must weigh at least 396 grams but no more than 453 grams. The prescribed weight is interesting because leather balls will become notorious for gaining weight when wet: the weight can almost double if the ball gets really soaked.
Scotland
February — Rangers F.C. is formed in Glasgow by four friends. The team's first pitch is on common land at Flesher's Haugh, Glasgow Green.
