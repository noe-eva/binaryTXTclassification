A pegasus crossing (United Kingdom; also equestrian crossing) is a type of signalised pedestrian crossing, with special consideration for horse riders. This type of crossing is nicknamed after the mythical winged horse, Pegasus. They are primarily used in the United Kingdom and Peru.
At a minimum, these crossings are in the form of a pelican crossing or puffin crossing but simply have two control panels, one at the normal height for pedestrians or dismounted riders, and one two metres above the ground for the use of mounted riders, and the "green man" (walk) and "red man" (stop) pictograms are replaced with horses. Additional features, to improve safety, include a wooden fence or other barrier and a wider crossing so that the horses are further away from vehicles than normal.
If the crossing is to be used by pedestrians and cyclists too, then a parallel, separate toucan crossing may be placed next to the pegasus crossing.


== Installation and removal ==

There are examples in Hyde Park, Richmond Park and village area of Wimbledon in London; Rayleigh, Essex; Colchester, Essex and Great Notley, Essex and Worsley, Salford as well as near Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey.
After completion of upgrading the A66 between Greta Bridgeâ€“Scotch Corner in 2007, two pegasus crossings were installed on the section of the dual carriageway in 2009, immediately to the west of Scotch Corner. These crossings included raised buttons for horse riders, safety fences and lights to control the traffic which consisted of only two orange lights. These crossings never became operational and with the exception of the safety fences were later removed.
There are also examples in use in Lima, Peru.
