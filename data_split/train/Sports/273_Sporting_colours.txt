Sporting colours, more often known merely as colours or house-colours, are awarded to members of a university or school who have excelled in a sport. Colours are traditionally worn in or on scarves, ties, blazers, gowns, cuff-links, and other items of apparel. The award system gives rise to phrases such as an Oxford Blue, meaning a person who was awarded a Blue by the University of Oxford. Similarly a Cambridge Blue is awarded by the University of Cambridge. Colours are not however, always known as 'a Blue'. A 'university sporting blue' is a generic term which stems from the Oxford and Cambridge Blue, but 'Colours' by definition may be any colour, and often reflect the colours associated with the school uniform, crest, or other significant semiotic.
In some award schemes, it is possible to receive a half colour, such as a Half-Blue. Typically, a given institution will award a single colour; for example, Cambridge and Oxford awards are different shades of blue, and the University of London awards a Purple.
American universities tend to award a varsity letter rather than a colour.
The system is common in the majority of British prep schools, independent schools and old schools of Australia and Sri Lanka. Often blazers are given to denote pupils who have achieved in a sport. The blazers are often distinct from the standard school blazer though often colours simply take the form of embellished arms or braided cord or ribbon edging on the standard blazer. Ties are also used as a common way of displaying representative colours.
