In American and Canadian sports, a fight song is a song associated with a team. In both professional and amateur sports, fight songs are a popular way for fans to cheer for their team. Although the term "fight song" is primarily used in the United States, the use of fight songs is commonplace around the world, but they may also be referred to as team anthems, team songs or games songs in other countries, even such as Australia, Mexico and New Zealand. Fight songs differ from stadium anthems, used for similar purposes, in that they are usually written specifically for the purposes of the team, whereas stadium anthems are not.
Hundreds of colleges have fight songs, some of which are over a century old. The oldest collegiate fight song in the United States is Boston College's "For Boston", composed by T.J. Hurley in 1885.
One of the oldest games songs in Australia is Melbourne Grammar's 'Play Together, Dark Blue Twenty', which is sung to the tune of 'The March of the Men of Harlech'.  It was composed by Ambrose John Wilson who was principal of the school from 1885-1893. This is not to be confused with the school hymn 'Ora et Labora' which is now sung to the tune of 'Jerusalem'.

Notes:
Colleges whose names begin with "University of" or "College of" are listed by traditional name; for example, the University of Cincinnati is listed under C, not U.
The service academies are universally referred to in sports media by their associated branch of service. This means, for example, that the United States Military Academy is found at A, for Army.
The abbreviation "St.", standing for "Saint", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out. Some schools officially abbreviate the word (such as St. John's University in New York City), while others officially spell it out (such as Saint Louis University).
Schools which are normally known by a different contraction of their official name, or an acronym/initialism, are listed by their most common name. Examples:
The University of California, Berkeley is most often referred to by American sports media as either "California" or "Cal", meaning it can be found at C.
The University of California, Los Angeles is generally called "UCLA", meaning it can be found at U.
A few branch campuses of state university systems prefer to be known by their city for athletics purposes. Among them are the University of North Carolina at Charlotte ("Charlotte"), University of Tennessee at Chattanooga ("Chattanooga"), University of Nebraska Omaha ("Omaha"), University of Wisconsin–Green Bay ("Green Bay"), and University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee ("Milwaukee"). Such schools can be found at the first letter of their city name.

Other regional campuses, such as California State University, Fresno, are listed by their regional name, meaning the aforementioned school can be found under F.
