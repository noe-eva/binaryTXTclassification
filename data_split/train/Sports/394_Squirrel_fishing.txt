Squirrel fishing is the sporting practice of "catching" squirrels and attempting to lift them into the air using a nut (preferably a peanut) tied to a string or fishing line, and optionally some kind of fishing pole.
There has been some debate over where modern squirrel fishing originated. The practice was popularized by Nicholas Middleton and Zmira Zilkha during their summers at Middlebury College Italian Language School, by Nikolas Gloy and Yasuhiro Endo at the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, and by the Berkeley Squirrel Fisher's Club (BSF), an official student group at the University of California, Berkeley, that has been featured in the campus newspaper. As of 2009, Ohio State University also had a squirrel fishing club.
Squirrel fishing occurred at least as early as 1889 in the United States.
