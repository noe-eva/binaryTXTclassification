Victor ludorum (or Victrix ludorum) is Latin for "the winner of the games." It is usually a trophy presented to the most successful team, club, or competitor at a sports event. It is common at rowing regattas and was traditional at some British state and public school sports days. It is usually presented to the athlete/competitor who has won the most events or who has accumulated the most points through competing in many events.
Female competitors usually compete for the Victrix ludorum.
