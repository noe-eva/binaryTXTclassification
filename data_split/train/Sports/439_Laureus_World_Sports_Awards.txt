The Laureus World Sports Awards is an annual award ceremony honoring remarkable individuals from the world of sports along with the greatest sporting achievements throughout the year. It was established in 1999 by Laureus Sport for Good Foundation founding patrons Daimler and Richemont and supported by its global partners Mercedes-Benz and IWC Schaffhausen. The first ceremony was held on 25 May 2000 in Monte Carlo.
In order to find the winners of the Awards, the Laureus Nominations Panel composed of professional sports editors, writers and broadcasters vote to create a shortlist of six nominations in five categories:
Laureus World Sportsman of the Year
Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year
Laureus World Team of the Year
Laureus World Comeback of the Year
Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year
The nominees of the two remaining categories are chosen by specialist panels:
Laureus World Action Sportsperson of the Year
Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability
Then, members of the Laureus World Sports Academy select the winner by voting in a secret ballot.
The Awards support the work of Laureus Sport for Good, which supports over 100 community projects in around 40 countries. These projects aim to use the power of sport the end violence, discrimination and disadvantage, and prove that sport has the power to change the world.
