Baseball Park is home to baseball in Western Australia. It was built in 2004, with a seating capacity of about 500 and standing room for a further 3,500. This is the first baseball-exclusive stadium in Perth since the demolition of Parry Field in the mid-1990s. Baseball Park was the venue of the 2007 Claxton Shield, which ran from 19 to 27 January 2007. The facility was known as Barbagallo Ballpark between mid 2010 and mid 2015, under a naming rights agreement with Perth luxury car dealership Barbagallo.


== Stage 2 development ==
Baseball Park underwent further expansion in 2007 in preparation for a new Australian Baseball League, which was originally intended to start in late 2007. The upgrades provided increased corporate facilities and public seating. In 2010, the facility underwent further upgrades between the end of the 2009-2010 Claxton Shield season and the start of the ABL, which began in November 2010. The upgrades included a new, permanent, terraced bar, a batter's eye in centre field and an electronic scoreboard, while the outfield fences were also brought in to help fix the shortage of home runs at the venue in previous Claxton Shield seasons. Furthermore, an enclosed members area, numbered seats, an improved playing surface, upgraded corporate boxes, fences around the terraces and a new gameday office building were part of the improvements.
