Complex training integrates strength training, plyometrics, and sometimes sport-specific movement. It consists of an intense strength exercise followed by a plyometric exercise.
Complex training activates and works the nervous system and fast twitch muscle fibers simultaneously. The strength exercise activates the fast twitch muscle fibers (responsible for explosive power). The plyometric movement stresses those muscle fibers that have been activated by the strength training movement. During this activated state, the muscles have a tremendous ability to adapt. This form of intense training can teach slow twitch muscle fibers to perform like fast twitch fibers.


== Rate of force ==
By integrating plyometrics with strength training, there is an added benefit of improving rate of force, the speed with which force is achieved in movement.


== Combat athletics ==
Strength training alone will not maximize speed or power. Combat athletes need the ability to explode with speed in addition to brute strength. Complex training is one of the most effective ways to improve power output for combat.
