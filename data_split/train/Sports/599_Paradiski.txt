Paradiski is a ski-area in the Tarentaise Valley offering uninterrupted skiing in between the areas of Les Arcs, Peisey-Vallandry and La Plagne. The area is linked, since December 2003, by the Vanoise Express. In total over the three resorts there are 160 lifts and 425 km (264 mi) of pistes, with 152 green/blue (beginner) runs, 79 red (intermediate), runs and 22 black (expert) runs.
Paradiski relies on the operation of the Vanoise Express. As a result of safety inspections in December 2007 the operators announced that this lift would be shut for the rest of the 2007/2008 season. It reopened for the 2008/2009 season and provides a rapid and spectacular connection between the two halves of the Paradiski.
The biggest concentration of world-class ski resorts in the world is in the Tarentaise Valley. The best known neighbour systems are Espace Killy (Val d'Isère and Tignes) and Les Trois Vallées (Courchevel, Meribel, Val Thorens and more). A weekly lift ticket in Paradiski gives skiers a choice to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the—by far—largest ski area in the world. However that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park.
