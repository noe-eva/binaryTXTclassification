A tournament director (TD) is an official at a competitive sporting or gaming event, who typically perform a number of key functions. The extent of the tournament director's duties varies depending on the size of the tournament, the nature of the competition, and the number of other officials to whom roles can be delegated.
Examples often include:
Declaring that competition may begin
Refereeing game play
Organizing elimination tournament brackets, or pairings of a Swiss system tournament
Tracking scores and statistics
Enforcing rules and regulations
Arbitrating disputes
Officiating awards ceremonies
In fencing, the tournament director is known by the French name, directoire technique (commonly abbreviated to DT).
