The Segrave Trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.


== History and background ==
The trophy is named in honour of Sir Henry Segrave, and has been awarded in most years since 1930.
A subsidiary award, the Segrave Medal, may also be given. Additionally, the Segrave Certificate of Achievement may be awarded to a person who is not a British national, but would otherwise qualify for recognition.
The trophy is awarded by the Royal Automobile Club. Past sponsors include Aston Martin.
