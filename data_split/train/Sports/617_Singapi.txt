Singapi is a term used in Chinni Daandu game, which is popular in southern Parts of India, Karnataka in particular. Players yell out Singapi as a term used for cancellation. When the Chinni is struck with the Daandu, and if the player who hits it is not really sure that the chinni goes to the intended place, or if he misses it, he calls "Singapi" to cancel the hit and try it again.
The same would hold good for the opponent, in that, if the opponent calls Singapi before the player, the player would not get a chance to play again.
