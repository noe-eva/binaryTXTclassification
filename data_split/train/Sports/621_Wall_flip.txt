A wall flip is an acrobatic move, similar to a back flip or back tuck done while running up a wall. It's featured in many action movies and is also incoperated into sports such as parkour.


== Variations ==
1 Step Wall Flip
This is the first wallflip variation, and is the easiest. The flipper runs toward a wall and plants his dominate foot on the wall and then pushes off the wall and begins to flip.
2 Step Wall Flip
This is considered to be the standard wallflip in tricking, freerunning, and gymnastics. The flipper runs towards a wall then plants his weak foot then his dominate foot on the wall. Then he pushes off the wall and begins to flip.
3 Step Wall Flip
A three step Wall Flip is just like a 2 Step Wall Flip where three steps are taken on the wall before fliping. This move is more difficult to do and more dangerous than a standard wall flip.
4 step Wall Flip
This is a Wall Flip with four steps taking up the wall before the trickster does the flip. It is a rare and very difficult move. Most of the time it is done in the gym although a 4 step on an actual urban wall is not unheard of.
