PHA training or peripheral heart action training is a form of bodybuilding circuit training that was popularized by former AAU Mr. America and Mr. Universe Bob Gajda in the 1960s. Some internet sites point out that Gajda always credited Arthur H. Steinhaus for developing the theory behind PHA.
The smaller muscles around the heart are worked on first before the larger muscles around the body's periphery.
The technique requires the exerciser continuously exercises over a long period of time with no breaks. It is typically performed using multi-muscle exercises such as squats, pulls and presses and follow a specific strategy so that no one muscle is covered in two corresponding exercises.
A common approach with PHA training is to alternate from upper body to lower body and back again. This is different from many other circuit-style approaches.
