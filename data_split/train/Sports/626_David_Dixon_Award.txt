David Dixon Award is a four-yearly award given to the outstanding athlete of each Commonwealth Games, based on their performance at the event, fair play, and overall contribution to their team's participation at the Commonwealth Games.
The award was introduced in the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and is named after the former honorary secretary of the Commonwealth Games Federation for 17 years, David Dixon.
The David Dixon Award from the 2014 Commonwealth Games was awarded to Francesca 'Frankie' Jones, who represented Wales in rhythmic gymnastics and won five silver medals and one gold.
