The Scorched Sole is a trail running event which was inaugurated on June 3, 2006 by the Kelowna Goats at Kelowna, British Columbia. Both 25 km and 50 km courses have been run since the inception of the race, a 50-mile course was added in 2009. The course typically changes every year, however the start area is always at the Stewart Road access to the Myra-Bellevue Provincial Park.
