Volley squash is a form of volleyball played within a squash court or similar sized enclosed space with a high ceiling. An 8-foot-high (2.4 m) net is placed at halfway across the squash court and a soft blowup ball similar in size to a football (soccer ball) is used. The game is played by two teams of four players each, and the first team to score 21 points wins. The rules are similar to those of volleyball, but with the ball able to rebound off the walls during a rally (though the serve must not hit a wall).
