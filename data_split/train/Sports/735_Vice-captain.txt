Vice-captain, alternate captain (ice hockey) or vice-skip (curling) may refer to a role in a number of sports immediately below the role of captain. The vice-captain may have a number of different roles, including substituting as captain when the regular captain is injured or unavailable, or becoming the new captain if the original captain can't actually be the captain anymore. A vice-captain is a different from a co-captain, in which there are at least two people who equally share the responsibilities of being the captain.
