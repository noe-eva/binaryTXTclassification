The leg extension is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs. The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine. There are various manufacturers of these machines and each one is slightly different. Most gym and weight rooms will have the machine in their facility. The leg extension is an isolated exercise targeting one specific muscle group, the quadriceps. It should not be considered as a total leg workout, such as the squat or deadlift.
The exercise consists of bending the leg at the knee and extending the legs, then lowering them back to the original position.


== Risk of Injury ==
Most fitness experts and coaches advise people to not use an isolating Leg Extension Machine due to the unnatural pressure it places on the knees and ankles. Regular use of the machine can lead to permanent knee injuries.
