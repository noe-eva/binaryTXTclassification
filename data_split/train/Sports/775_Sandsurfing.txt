Sandsurfing or Desertsurfing is an extreme sport recently invented and involves "surfing on sand", mostly in deserts. It is similar to waterskiing.


== Principles ==
Sandsurfers attach a skateboard deck or other similar object to the back of an ATV or vehicle with a watersports tow rope. The first sandsurfing in the Malibu area was done on san dunes approximately 35 miles north of Malibu off the coast highway in the early 1960s where young surfers would take their long boards and slide down the mountainside of sand when the surf was down.


== History and recognition ==
Sandsurfing was invented and popularized by skateboarding and now Demigod of sandsurfing Joey Manalis. It was first recognized as an extreme sporting event in March '06 in the first annual sandsurfing tournament sponsored by Thrasher Magazine, Skateboarder Magazine, Pro Tec helmets, and DC shoe company. It was mentioned in the April '06 issue of Thrasher Magazine and the May '06 issue of SLAP magazine.

Sandsurfing is usually practiced in vast deserts where there is an abundance of sand dunes. Participants of this sport are to climb up the sand dune and surf downwards. Sand Surfers must be extremely fit; as they must climb massive sand dunes in vast deserts.
