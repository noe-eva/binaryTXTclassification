The Ice Breaker Road Race, held annually in Great Falls, Montana in April of each year, is a road race that draws over 3,000 walkers, joggers and marathoners. The race was established in 1980 and has been run annually ever since. The course starts in Downtown Great Falls at the Civic Center, going East through the business district, winds through several residential neighborhoods, across the scenic Central Avenue West Bridge and eventually ends up back downtown.
Prizes are awarded between the top finishers in the 5-mile (TAC-RRCA Certified) and 3-mile races.
