Duck on a Rock is a medieval childrenâ€™s game.


== Game play ==
Duck on a Rock is a game that combined tag and marksmanship. It is played by placing a somewhat large stone (known as a "duck") upon a larger stone or a tree stump. One player stays near the stone to guard it. The other players throw stones at the duck in an attempt to knock it off of the platform. Once it is knocked off, the throwers all rush to retrieve their stones. If a player is tagged before returning to the throwing line with his or her stone, they become the guard. The guard cannot tag anyone until he picks up a duck at his feet, nor can he chase anyone until he puts the original duck back up on its platform.
Recent findings suggest basketball may have been influenced by this game.
