The coach's box is a term used in numerous sports. In baseball, it is the space where the first base coach and third base coach stands.
It is also common practice for a coach who has a play at his base to leave the coachâ€™s box to signal the player to slide, advance or return to a base. This may be allowed by the umpire if the coach does not interfere with the play in any manner.
In basketball, it's a line that represents how far a coach may come towards centercourt. In soccer, the coach's box is simply a term for the typical area that the coach or manager is standing.
