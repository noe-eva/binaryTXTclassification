== Description ==
Exercise motion is detected in the same way calorie counter and exercise computers count repetitions on individual exercise machines. When exercise motion ceases, for the period of time dependent on the difficulty setting, the game controller input is stopped. Any game can be used as this approach does not interact directly with the game control.
Exercise machines are only suitable when balance can be maintained and hands are free to operate game controllers. For this reason treadmills and rowing machines are not suitable and could be dangerous.


== Approach ==
The Gamercize approach is to use minimalist interaction between the exercise performed by the user and the game played. This enables compatibility with existing games without making the gameplay harder or less enjoyable.


== Purpose ==
Exergaming is intended to provide entertainment through playing video games whilst exercising on fitness equipment.
