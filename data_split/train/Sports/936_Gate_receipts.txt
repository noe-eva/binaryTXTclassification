Gate receipts, or simply "gate," is the sum of money taken at a sporting venue for the sale of tickets.
Traditionally, gate receipts were largely or entirely taken in cash. Today, many sporting venues will operate a season ticket scheme, which will mean they allocate a proportion of season ticket moneys when announcing gate receipts for a particular event.
"Gate" is also sometimes used in reference to the number of people in attendance.
