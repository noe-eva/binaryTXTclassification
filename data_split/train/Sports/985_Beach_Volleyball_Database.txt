The Beach Volleyball Database is an online website that holds extensive information about international beach volleyball players, tournaments and history. News are frequently updated, and the site has results for continental and international tournaments. It is the only website of its kind in the sport of beach volleyball.
The press operations officer for the AVP, Tim Simmons, has said that the Beach Volleyball Database has had a major impact on the sport. Information that is now easily accessible through the website, used to take time consuming research through different sources. Now professional athletes have a chance to set long-term goals based on their long-term results in comparison to other professional beach volleyball players.
