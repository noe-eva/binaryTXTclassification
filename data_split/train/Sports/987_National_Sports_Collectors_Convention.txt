The National Sports Collectors Convention is the largest, annual trade show held in the United States devoted to sports memorabilia. Also known as The National, the convention has been held annually since 1980 when a small handful of sports card collectors convened at a hotel located adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport. The show changes location each year to allow people from all areas of the country to participate. The show also changes the autograph signers each year.
The 33rd National was held at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland, August 1–5, 2012.
The 32nd National was held at the Donald E Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont, Illinois, August 3–7, 2011 and included a total of 89 current and former professional athlete autograph signers.
The 31st annual convention was held August 2010 at the Baltimore Convention Center. In addition to approximately 600 dealer booths which buy, sell and trade sports memorabilia, the National is host to over 60 celebrity autograph guests during its week-long run including names such as Cal Ripken, Jr., Bob Gibson, and John Havlicek. The Baltimore Business Journal ranked The National as the show with the highest economic impact for the city in 2010. The estimated impact of $15.48 million surpassed the second-ranked convention by nearly $4 million.
